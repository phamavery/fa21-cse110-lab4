1. The code will print 3. This is because i was declared as var
2. The code will print 150. discountedPrice is declared var so we can access it. In the last iteration of the loop, discountPrice = 150
3. The code will print 150. Same reason as above.
4. [50,100,150]. First iteration, finalPrice = 50, second is 100, third is 150.
5. Error because i is out of scope
6. Error because discountedPrice is out of scope
7. The code will print 150. finalPrice was declared in the same scope.
8. [50,100,150]. First iteration, finalPrice = 50, second is 100, third is 150.
9. The code will have an error because i is out of scope
10. The code will print 3 because length is in scope
11. The code will return [50,100,150]. Although discounted was declared const, arrays in JavaScript are not constant
12. 
    A. student.name

    B. student['Grad Year']

    C. student.greeting()

    D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name

    E. student.courseLoad[0]
13.
    A. 32 because 2 is concatenated to 3
    
    B. 1 because '3' is mapped to 3

    C. 3 because null will be 0

    D. '3null' because null is converted to a string

    E. 4 because true is mapped to 1

    F. 0 because both are mapped to 0

    G. '3undefined' because undefined is casted to a string

    H. NaN. Undefined is not a number

14.
    A. true because 2 is casted to integer

    B. false because '12' is smaller lexicographically

    C. true because '2' is converted to 2

    D. false because different types

    E. false because true maps to 1

    F. true because Boolean(2) is true

15. == has type conversion but === doesn't
16. 
17. The result will be [2,4,6]. The modify array function calls the doSomething function on every element, so each element in the original array will be doubled.
